# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
One way I can ensure that my code is functional and secure is through unit and integeration testing. With unit testing I can 
test the function, method, or class is performing as intended without bugs. Through integration testing I can test my code 
end-to-end and ensure all components of the software are working as intended. 

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
User needs are collected through initial conversation and then documented into the work flow. When interpetting user needs, it's
important to remove any and all bias and create software that is specific to what they're asking for. When I'm reading the initial documentation
and collecting their needs, I always ensure to uncover and udnerstand the problem and how the software will fix this problem. 

# How do I approach designing software?
When I design software, I always like to understand the current problem and if any resolutions have been attempted before. By understanding
the problem at hand I can design my software around solving their problem. If this needs to work with another piece of software
I try to plan my solution around the current code base and the look at it from a "big picture" perspective to understand holistically.
